# EntryListWithBlinking_ReubenPython2and3Class
Custom Tkinter GUI object that displays labeled Entry objects (corresponding to variable names) so that the user can type in values (int, float, and str type). Great for changing gains on-the-fly during PID debugging. Each entry can be instructed to blink to prompt a user to enter a value if the entry is left unfilled.
